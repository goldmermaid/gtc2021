# Dive into Deep Learning:
### Code Side-by-Side with MXNet, PyTorch & TensorFlow

Speaker: Rachel Hu (AWS AI)

---

Deep learning is transforming the world nowadays. To fulfill the strong wishes of simpler but more practical deep learning materials, [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/), a unified resource of deep learning was born to achieve the following goals:

- Adopt the 3 most popular deep leraning frameworks: MXNet, PyTorch and TensorFlow;
- Offer depth theory and runnable code, showing readers how to solve problems in practice;
- Allow for rapid updates, both by us, and also by the community at large;
- Be complemented by a forum for interactive discussions of technical details and to answer questions;
- Be freely available for everyone.




## Prerequisites


### GPU Fundamentals

- [Installations with CUDA](https://d2l.ai/chapter_installation/index.html)
- [Basic Operations on GPUs](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/mli/d2l-1day-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks-2/1-use-gpu.ipynb#/)
- [Hardware for deep learning](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computational-performance/hardware.html#gpus-and-other-accelerators)


### Deep Learning Fundamentals

Here are a few concepts that will be the prerequistes for this lecture. Take a look if some of them are not familiar to you! :)

## Syllabus

In this training, we are going to provide an overview of the in-depth convolutional neural networks (CNN) theory and handy python code. What is more important, the audience would be able to train a simple CNN model on our pre-setup cloud-computing instances for free. Here are the detailed schedule:

### Resources and Q&A 


- [AutoGluon](https://autogluon.mxnet.io/) enables easy-to-use and easy-to-extend AutoML with a focus on deep learning and real-world applications spanning image, text, or tabular data;

- [Deep Graph Libray](https://www.dgl.ai/) develops easy-to-use, high performance and scalable Python package for deep learning on graphs;

- [GluonTS](https://gluon-ts.mxnet.io/) supports deep learning based probabilistic time series modeling;

- [TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/): automatic generates and optimizes tensor operators on more backend with better performance for CPUs, GPUs and specialized accelerators.


If you have any question, please leave us a message at our [discussion forum](https://discuss.mxnet.io/c/d2l-book). Have fun diving into deep learning!
